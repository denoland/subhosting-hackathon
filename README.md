# Deno Subhosting Hackathon: Build a Cloud IDE

_[Read more in our announcement post.](https://deno.com/blog/subhosting-hackathon)_

To submit a project for the hackathon, you must build a browser-based IDE that
executes JavaScript or TypeScript code using the
[Subhosting API](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/subhosting). Your project
can be either:

- a net new project featuring a browser-based IDE that uses subhosting
- an existing project with a newly added browser-based IDE that uses subhosting

When you have built an application that mathces this description,
[please submit it here](https://github.com/denoland/subhosting-hackathon/issues/new)
and include the following key information:

- Title
- Description of your project
- A URL to a demoable product or a video demo

Note that all projects must successfully run code on Deno Subhosting
infrastructure. For existing projects that have added a cloud IDE, we will also
accept a video demo in lieu of a demoable URL.

We will accept submissions **until 12pm noon Pacific Time on Thursday, January
18th**. We'll announce winners Friday, January 19th.

## Not sure what to build?

There are plenty of great cloud based IDEs out there, some meant for specific
purposes such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) for frontends and
[Val.town](http://Val.town) for serverless JavaScript functions, to more general
ones like [Repl.it](http://Repl.it) or [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Then
there are IDEs built into SaaS products like
[Salesforce’s code builder](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2020/06/introducing-code-builder)
that allows developers to extend its features. Regardless of their purpose, the
streamlined development experience of these IDEs enables you to skip
configuration and dive right into prototyping.

Here are some examples that we believe can be built within the scope of this
hackathon.

- Create and deploy a Discord or Slack bot from a browser IDE
- Create and deploy Alexa Actions/Skills from a browser IDE
- Handle webhooks with code written in the browser
- Implement OpenAI
  [functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) with
  browser-based code

Whatever you build, it will need to take code from a browser and run it with the
[Subhosting API](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/subhosting). We can't wait
to see how creative you can get with this prompt.

## Resources

Here are a few links and resources to help you get started.

- [Monaco editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) - an open source
  browser-based editor used by VS Code, which may be useful to implement
  browser-based code editing. You might consider other alternatives like
  [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) or [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/) as well.
- [Subhosting quick start guide](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/manual/subhosting)
- [Subhosting REST API reference](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/api/rest)

Over the coming days, we will also be announcing new resources and live code
streams to share some tips and tricks.
[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/deno) and update your role to include
`events` to stay in the loop!

## Prizes

We’ll reward prizes based on the following categories.

- Most fun
- Most useful
- Most technical
- Ryan’s favorite

All winners will receive $100 gift card for
[Deno Merch](https://merch.deno.com).
